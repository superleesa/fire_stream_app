# Fire Stream App

This application uses Spark to processes incoming fire and weather data by classifying if a fire is man-made or natural, and storing these classified data to MongoDB for later analysis/visualization uses.
To simulate the incoming weather data and fire data, we created three servers and Kafka producers.
